## Creating a blog about the difference between HTTP/1.1 vs HTTP/2

  - The Hyper Text Transfer Protocol is most commonly used protocol in the world.
  - https protocol is used for viewing web page on the internet.
  - Whenever we type web address https automatically added before on the web address.
  - intial state we use http , it have a problem as far as security and this why https was developed.
  - https stands for secure hypertext transfer protocol .
  - https ensures that all the data that is being transferred over the internet between computers and servers is secure by making the data impossible to read by using encryption algrithms.

  - https use the secure sockets layer,it  is a protocol that is used to ensure security on the internet use public key encryption to secure the data.

  - Now we discussed difference between http/1.1 vs http/2 based on the perfomance 

  - Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) it have set of standards allowing internet users to exchange website information. 

  - Since 1991 we use http. HTTP/2 was released in 2015.

## MULTIPLEXING 
###  multiple signals are transmitted over a physical medium

 - HTTP/1.1 only allows a single request and response to be sent over a single connection at a time.

-  HTTP/2 allows multiple requests and responses to be sent over a single connection.

## HEADER
### Data Storing Blocks

- HTTP/1.1 sends headers with each request and response,because of that result is lot of overhead and slow down performance.

- HTTP/2 uses header compression to reduce the size of header data, This also helps to improve the efficiency of the protocol and reduce latency.

## PRIORITIZE REQUESTS
### Prioritizing Network Traffic

- HTTP/1.1 does not provide a prioritizing requests, that means requests can be processed in any order, based on their importance or urgency.

- HTTP/2 allows the client to specify the priority of requests, it can improve the responsiveness of the protocol and reduce latency.

## SERVER PUSH
### The delivery of information to the Web browser from the user

- HTTP/ 1.1 does not support server push, because the server cannot initiate the transfer of data to the client without first receiving a request.

- HTTP/2 allows the server to send multiple responses to a single request, it can improve web application performance like  speed and efficiency.

## TCP Connections

### This is a connection-oriented protocol in communication field & it is used to exchange the messages between different devices over a network

- HTTP/1.1 is the underlying TCP protocol for reliable data transfer.

- HTTP/2 is use binary protocol and it is  allows to multiple parallel requests over a single TCP connection.
